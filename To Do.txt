- Consider adding some sort of notice element, which can be displayed for licenses where the text, official link, or certain third-party sources have been intentionally excluded. It can clarify the reason (e.g., "Due to Copyright concerns with the license text, some elements have been excluded from this page.", "The license text has been excluded, because no permission to distribute it has been given.", "Due to safety concerns, some elements have been excluded from this page."). This would be especially useful for crayon licenses derived without permission (or without documented permission) from existing works.
